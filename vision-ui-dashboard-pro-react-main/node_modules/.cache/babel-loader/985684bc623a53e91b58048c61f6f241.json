Don’t be afraid to be wrong because\n            you can’t learn anything from a compliment. I always felt like I could do anything.\n            That’s the main thing people are controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of\n            themselves! They&apos;re slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you&apos;re\n            taught you can’t do anything, you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.\n          </FaqCollapse>\n          <Divider light />\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    </VuiBox>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Faq;\n"],"mappings":";;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA,SAASA,QAAT,QAAyB,OAAzB,C,CAEA;;AACA,OAAOC,IAAP,MAAiB,oBAAjB;AACA,OAAOC,OAAP,MAAoB,uBAApB,C,CACA;;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,mBAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,aAAP,MAA0B,0BAA1B,C,CAEA;;AACA,OAAOC,WAAP,MAAwB,mDAAxB;;;AAEA,SAASC,GAAT,GAAe;EAAA;;EACb,MAAM,CAACC,QAAD,EAAWC,WAAX,IAA0BR,QAAQ,CAAC,KAAD,CAAxC;EAEA,oBACE,QAAC,MAAD;IAAQ,EAAE,EAAE;MAAES,EAAE,EAAE,EAAN;MAAUC,EAAE,EAAE;IAAd,CAAZ;IAAA,uBACE,QAAC,IAAD;MAAM,SAAS,MAAf;MAAgB,cAAc,EAAC,QAA/B;MAAA,wBACE,QAAC,IAAD;QAAM,IAAI,MAAV;QAAW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAf;QAAmB,EAAE,EAAE,CAAvB;QAA0B,EAAE,EAAC,MAA7B;QAAA,wBACE,QAAC,aAAD;UAAe,QAAQ,EAAE,EAAzB;UAA6B,KAAK,EAAC,OAAnC;UAA2C,KAAK,EAAC,QAAjD;UAA0D,UAAU,EAAC,MAArE;UAA4E,YAAY,MAAxF;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAIE,QAAC,MAAD;UAAQ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAZ;UAAA,uBACE,QAAC,aAAD;YACE,QAAQ,EAAE,EADZ;YAEE,UAAU,EAAC,SAFb;YAGE,KAAK,EAAC,OAHR;YAIE,KAAK,EAAC,QAJR;YAKE,KAAK,EAAC,MALR;YAAA,+FAQE;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QARF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAkBE,QAAC,IAAD;QAAM,IAAI,MAAV;QAAW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAf;QAAmB,EAAE,EAAE,EAAvB;QAAA,wBACE,QAAC,WAAD;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,iBADR;UAEE,IAAI,EAAEH,QAAQ,KAAK,CAFrB;UAGE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,CAAb,GAAiBC,WAAW,CAAC,KAAD,CAA5B,GAAsCA,WAAW,CAAC,CAAD,CAHnE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAWE,QAAC,OAAD;UAAS,KAAK;QAAd;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAXF,eAYE,QAAC,WAAD;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,6BADR;UAEE,IAAI,EAAED,QAAQ,KAAK,CAFrB;UAGE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,CAAb,GAAiBC,WAAW,CAAC,KAAD,CAA5B,GAAsCA,WAAW,CAAC,CAAD,CAHnE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAZF,eA0BE,QAAC,OAAD;UAAS,KAAK;QAAd;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA1BF,eA2BE,QAAC,WAAD;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,kDADR;UAEE,IAAI,EAAED,QAAQ,KAAK,CAFrB;UAGE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,CAAb,GAAiBC,WAAW,CAAC,KAAD,CAA5B,GAAsCA,WAAW,CAAC,CAAD,CAHnE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3BF,eAyCE,QAAC,OAAD;UAAS,KAAK;QAAd;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAzCF,eA0CE,QAAC,WAAD;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,4BADR;UAEE,IAAI,EAAED,QAAQ,KAAK,CAFrB;UAGE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,CAAb,GAAiBC,WAAW,CAAC,KAAD,CAA5B,GAAsCA,WAAW,CAAC,CAAD,CAHnE;UAAA,sUASE;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QATF,eAUE;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAVF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA1CF,eA2DE,QAAC,OAAD;UAAS,KAAK;QAAd;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3DF,eA4DE,QAAC,WAAD;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,uCADR;UAEE,IAAI,EAAED,QAAQ,KAAK,CAFrB;UAGE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAOA,QAAQ,KAAK,CAAb,GAAiBC,WAAW,CAAC,KAAD,CAA5B,GAAsCA,WAAW,CAAC,CAAD,CAHnE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5DF,eAyEE,QAAC,OAAD;UAAS,KAAK;QAAd;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAzEF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAlBF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADF;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAkGD;;GArGQF,G;;KAAAA,G;AAuGT,eAAeA,GAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
